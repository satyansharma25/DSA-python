    "\n",
    "2. **Item Cannot Be Included:**\n",
    "   - If the weight of the current item (`wt[n-1]`) is greater than the remaining knapsack capacity (`W`), the item cannot be included in the solution. \n",
    "   - The function recursively calls itself with the same knapsack capacity (`W`) and one item less (`n-1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Item Can Be Included:**\n",
    "   - The function considers two cases:\n",
    "     - **Include the current item:** \n",
    "       - Calculate the value obtained by including the current item: `val[n-1] + knapSack(W-wt[n-1], wt, val, n-1)`. \n",
    "       - `W-wt[n-1]` represents the remaining capacity after including the current item's weight.\n",
    "     - **Exclude the current item:** \n",
    "       - Calculate the value obtained by excluding the current item: `knapSack(W, wt, val, n-1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Maximum:**\n",
    "   - Return the maximum value between the two cases (including and excluding the current item).\n",

    "## Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another approach in Dynamic Programming for the 0/1 Knapsack problem called **Memoization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Create a 2D table `K` of size `(n+1) x (W+1)` and initialize all its elements to -1, indicating that the subproblems are not yet solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memoized Recursive Function:**\n",
    "   - The `knapSackMemoized` function first checks if the result for the current subproblem (defined by `n` and `W`) is already stored in the table (`K[n][W]` != -1). \n",
    "   - If it's stored, the function directly returns the stored result.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, it proceeds with the same logic as the recursive solution:\n",
    "     - Base case: If `n` is 0 or `W` is 0, return 0.\n",
    "     - If the weight of the current item is greater than the remaining capacity, exclude the item and recursively solve the subproblem with one less item.\n",
    "     - If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the remaining capacity, consider both including and excluding the item, recursively solve the subproblems for both cases, and store the maximum value in the table `K[n][W]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result:**\n",
    "   - The `knapSack` function calls the `knapSackMemoized` function to start the process and returns the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memoization uses a top-down approach, starting with the original problem and breaking it down into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "- It avoids redundant calculations by storing the results of solved subproblems in the table.\n",
    "- Like Tabulation, it has a time complexity of O(nW) and space complexity of O(nW).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Memoization and Tabulation are effective dynamic programming approaches for the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The choice between them often depends on personal preference and the specific problem characteristics.\n"
